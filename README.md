## Requirements

- NodeJS (with npm)
- Visual Studio Code
- git [LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/)

## Observations

- The server was tested to work with **NodeJS v20.11.1**, if you are using a different version and experiencing difficulties change it before looking for support
- If you are updating a branch you've had for some time, run `npm ci` before running any tasks. This will run the clean and install target from npm.
- You can debug your mods using the server, just copy your mod files into the `user/mods` folder and put breakpoints on the **JS** files. **DO NOT** contact the dev team for support on this.

## Pulling
- Run `git lfs fetch` and `git lfs pull` to acquire loot files
